# 👋 Hi, I'm SegovChik

### 🌟 About Me
- 💻 In IT since 2018: 2 years in system administration + 5 years in production DevOps / Platform Engineering.
- 🚀 Focus: Highly available, secure, and scalable infrastructure for demanding workloads (LLM inference, video analysis, blockchain infra).
- 🧩 I enjoy turning fragmented infra into cohesive internal developer platforms.

### 🗣️ Languages
- English: B2 (comfortable with technical discussions, documentation, and async collaboration)

### 🛠️ Core Skills & Tooling
- Kubernetes (CKA, CKAD) — bare-metal & cloud, GPU scheduling for AI workloads
- HashiCorp: Terraform (multi-env modules), Vault (certified; secure secret & key lifecycle)
- Platform Engineering: Internal developer platforms (golden paths, self-service infra, GitOps patterns)
- Observability: Prometheus, Loki, Alertmanager, Grafana
- CI/CD: GitHub Actions, Argo CD, custom runners, multi-stage promotion workflows
- Security: Vault-based signing, KMS integrations, isolated key custody, secrets rotation, supply chain hardening (SBOM, image signing)
- Cloud & Infra: AWS, GCP, Azure, DigitalOcean, Hetzner, OVH, Latitude.sh + hybrid & bare-metal automation
- Packaging & Runtime: Helm, Kustomize, container hardening, artifact registries (GHCR, ECR, GCR)

### ⛓️ Blockchain & Web3 Infrastructure Experience
Worked across:
- L1 Blockchains: Full nodes, validators, archive nodes, RPC endpoints
- MEV Service Providers: Low-latency relays, builder infra, network segregation
- Mining Pools: High-throughput job distribution, payout reliability
- Staking Providers: Validator HA, slashing prevention, key handling
- Explorer / Data Providers: Indexing backends, caching layers, API scaling
- Key Management: Private key custody (Vault plugins / isolated signers)

### 🔄 End-to-End Platform & Delivery
I have built:
- Internal Developer Platform: Self-service namespace/app bootstrap, templates, RBAC guardrails
- Multi-Cluster Ops: Promotion workflows, drift detection
- Secret & Key Security: Segmented scopes, transit encryption/signing, rotation workflows
- Reliability Enhancements: SLO-based alerting, synthetic probes, autoscaling (HPA/KEDA)
- Cost & Capacity: Rightsizing, bin-packing optimization, GPU pooling strategies

### 🔐 Private Key / Security Solutions
- Vault-backed signing for blockchain + infra credentials
- Isolated signer services with strict policy boundaries
- Backup & recovery workflows (shamir, sealed storage)
- Auditable cryptographic operation pipelines

### 🛰️ Representative Project Domains
- Mining pools
- MEV service infrastructure
- L1 blockchain networks

### 📊 Operations
- Unified telemetry stack (metrics/logs)
- Capacity & saturation dashboards
- Incident response runbooks & on-call enablement
- Failure drill / resilience preparation

### 🌟 Leadership
- Managed a 5-person DevOps / Platform team (mentorship, roadmap ownership)
- Cross-functional collaboration with backend, security, and data teams

### 🧾 Certifications
- CKA (Certified Kubernetes Administrator)
- CKAD (Certified Kubernetes Application Developer)
- HashiCorp Vault (Certified)

### 🚀 Interests
- Scaling secure blockchain & AI infra
- Developer productivity & platform maturity
- GitOps-enforced delivery and governance
